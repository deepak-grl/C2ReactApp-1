                        GRL-C2 provides an automated, efficient, and fully-integrated way perform all required USB Power Delivery version 3.0 and 2.0
                        and related tests over the USB Type-C connector, as well as PHY test automation for USB Type-C Alternate Modes.
                        GRL-C2 automates all required USB PD compliance tests for power providers (chargers), consumers, dual-role ports, and cable
                        and adapter E-Markers; and is the only solution available that integrates Qualcomm Quick Charge 4+ and 
                        Intel Thunderbolt-specific test items. GRL-C2 also incorporates analyzer capability to sniff PD traffic.
                        GRL-C2 integrates all required USB PD tests into a single 2-port tester, including all tests supported on GRLâ€™s USB-IF 
                        approved first generation solution introduced in 2015. Each port can be configured independently as a PD Provider or Consumer.
                        All other PD Protocol and Power tests are fully integrated, removing the need for external electronic loads.
